## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Security hardening is prioritized before scalability work
- Initialization: Existing architecture is preserved; this is not a rewrite
- Initialization: Portfolio uptime, worker reliability, and auth control are non-negotiable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Repository must be made open-source safe before public release
- Worker silent failure remains a top operational risk until observability is improved
- Critical automated coverage is currently missing across the monorepo
